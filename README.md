Password Strength Analyzer
Password Strength Analyzer is a C++ cybersecurity project that evaluates the strength of user passwords based on length, character variety, and entropy calculation.

The application estimates brute-force attack time, categorizes passwords as weak, medium, or strong, and provides suggestions to improve security.

This project demonstrates core cybersecurity concepts such as password complexity analysis, entropy modeling, and attack simulation in a simple and practical way.
