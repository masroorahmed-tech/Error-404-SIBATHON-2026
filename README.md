# SecurePass Pro 🛡️
**Intelligent Password Strength Analyzer & Personalized Secure Password Generator**

A beginner-friendly yet powerful cybersecurity hackathon project that helps users understand, evaluate, and create **strong, secure, and memorable passwords**.

### What it does
- Analyzes password strength using **entropy calculation**, character variety, and real-world attack simulation
- Estimates **brute-force crack time** (seconds → centuries)
- Detects common weaknesses: keyboard patterns, repeats, years, phone numbers, substitutions
- Suggests **improvements** to make weak passwords stronger
- Generates **personalized secure passwords** using your first name + last name + lucky number (memorable but strong!)
- Creates fully random high-entropy passwords

### Core Features
- Password improvement engine
- Name-based secure generator (looks related to your identity)
- Beautiful modern web UI (animated strength bar, dark/light mode)

### Built With
- **C++** (backend logic – entropy, detection, generation)
- **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** (modern responsive frontend)

### Why this project?
Most password checkers just say "weak" without explaining **why** or **how to fix it**.  
SecurePass Pro educates users, prevents predictable passwords, and solves the real problem:  
**"I want a strong password that's still easy to remember."**

Perfect for students, everyday users, and cybersecurity awareness.  
Made with passion for secure digital life. ❤️
